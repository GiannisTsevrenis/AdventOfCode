# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This repo contains my solutions to the daily programming challenges posted on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

If you're having a hard time understanding my thought process or approach to a specific challenge, check out the `README.md` file in the relevant day's folder.

## Language

All solutions are written in **Java** <img src="https://images.javatpoint.com/core/images/java-logo3.png" alt="Java Logo" width="20" height="20" />. You can find both part 1 and part 2 solutions for each day in separate java files.

## Disclaimer

The solutions are not the most optimal: They are not the shortest possible solutions and they are certainly not the fastest ones. They are simply my first attempt at each puzzle.

## Requirements

- **Java** (JDK 21 or higher recommended)
- No third-party libraries are required unless specified.

Happy coding and enjoy the puzzles! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰
