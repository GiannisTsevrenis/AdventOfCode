# Advent of Code 2024

This repo contains my solutions to the daily programming challenges posted on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

If you're having a hard time understanding my thought process or approach to a specific challenge, check out the `README.md` file in the relevant day's folder.

## Language

All solutions are written in **Java**. You can find both part 1 and part 2 solutions for each day in separate java files.

## Disclaimer

The solutions are not the most optimal: They are not the shortest possible solutions and they are certainly not the fastest ones. They are simply my first attempt at each puzzle.
